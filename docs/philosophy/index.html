				<p>There was a time I felt very bad about the people who caused lot of trouble to my life. As I grow up with experience today I feel I'm really grateful to the people who did so. Thanks to their continuous encouragement I never gave up untill I reach a better living. I have gained lot of success and satisfaction by concentrating on how to make my life happy and successful without hating the people who troubled me. If anyone reading is suffering because of any trouble, it's time to stop worrying about that and start working on the solution with a free and happy mind.</p>

				<p>I'm ending this post by thanking few people.</p>

				<p>Thank you who left me behind saying I'm lacking external beauty. After concentrating on my inner beauty (beauty of heart) I am gifted to have a loving family who always admires who I am.</p>

				<p>Thank you who troubled during the time I stayed in my motherland. Thanks to them, I have got the permanent residensy in a developed country and living a peaceful life with very good living condition than I could have never experienced in Sri Lanka.</p>
